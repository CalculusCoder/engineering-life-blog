## Life Before Software Engineering and Tech🚚

Life before software engineering and tech was confusing. I was 22 years old and working as a truck driver across the United States. I had no idea how I ended up there; just two years ago, I was on my way to completing my bachelor's in engineering and somehow ended up hauling 70,000 lbs in the middle of nowhere in Kansas at 2 AM. I remember being parked in an isolated gas station staring into the pitch black vast space of Kansas, contemplating my life, nearly freezing in the 5 degree weather.

Like most young adults, I was lost and looking for direction in any place I could. I didn't have family to ask advice from, so I just lived my life on edge, looking for something that would work for me. Eventually, I found that trucking was not my calling. I quit my job and went back home, hoping I could find guidance from friends. Once home, I reconnected with my friends: Isaac and Miguel, who provided me with guidance and support about my future.

Seeing my friends again was the best decision I've ever made. With them, I discovered my true self. I realized I was an innovator, inventor, and a creative mind. I loved learning, even though it hadn't dawned on me before. That's when things started to change; as I drove home that night, I made the decision to dive back into engineering and innovation.

When I got home, I began researching various tech and engineering fields. That's when I stumbled upon software engineering, a field that many influencers said you could learn on your own. I saw several ads promising to make anyone a software engineer in just five months. Reading several success stories of self-taught and bootcamp-trained software engineers and web developers, I began to believe I could do it too. From that day on, I voyaged into the deepest darkest depths of web development and software engineering.

## Making the Transition📓📚

I embarked on my self-taught journey on May 1, 2022. After conducting thorough research into the tech field and software engineering, I found a simple path that served as a great starting point. Like many self-taught web developers, I began with the basics: HTML and CSS. Understanding the connection between computers and software fueled my passion even more for software development.

#### My First Program

#### My Learning Tech Stack

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **Javascript**
- **React**
- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Heroku (Deployment)**

Taking advantage of some great free resources available online, I committed to a consistent learning schedule. I programmed and studied for 30 to 50 hours a week, hoping to secure my first job as fast as possible. At times I would be overwhelmed due to the amount of content I thought I had to learn. I concentrated on the most insignificant topics in HTML and CSS, such as memorizing all HTML tags and CSS properties. Fortunately, I learned from these errors and recognized that my approach to learning web development needed a change.

Evenutally, my front-end development skills started to level up. I managed to build and deploy my first basic web application: a landing page integrated with Mailchimp. Despite being a simple web application, I was satisfied with my progress and current skill set. My hard work and perseverance were beginning to pay off.

## The Inevitable Rough Patch🪖

Around one to two months into my self-taught software engineering journey, I came across the dreaded inevitable rough patch/stage. At this point in my studies, I was diving deep into Javascript, React, and Node.js. I felt stuck, as if I was struggling to grasp any concept. Concepts that did stick would dissipate after a couple of days. My frustrations grew, but thankfully so did my determination.

This is the stage where many self-taught developers fail and throw in the towel. Stagnation and mounting frustrations make them feel as if they'll never master web development. Ironically, the best way to overcome this stage is by taking a step back and avoiding burn out. Many developers increase their study hours and become frustrated when their attempts bear no fruit. Developers who quit at this stage often overlook an essential truth: a breakthrough often follows the toughest times.

## Losing Everything⛈️

Three to four months into my self-guided learning journey, my life took a dramatic turn. I came down with several severe anxiety disorders that changed the course of my life. I went from living my best life to losing everything overnight. Unfortunately, due to the severity of my condition, I had no choice but to give up my learning journey for six months.

Those six months were undoubtedly the most challenging and worst of my life, as I was barely able to function. My days were filled with disappointment, depression, anguish, and a sense of hopelessness. I was afraid I'd never be able to continue my journey, seeing no light at the end of the tunnel. Just when I had made the greatest transition in my life, it was all stripped away from me.

## Overcoming All Setbacks💪🏼

After about seven months, I gradually began to get back into the swing of things. Despite occasionally feeling disoriented due to anxiety disorders, I persisted, driven by my main goal: landing my first job as a software engineer. This time around, I returned stronger and more prepared. I had more tools at my disposal to become a prominent engineer.

I utilized the advantageous features of AI to enhance my skill set. I began by tackling advanced concepts of JavaScript, such as async-await, promises, callback functions, hoisting, and scoping, among others. I took a similar approach with React, familiarizing myself with features like the Context API, hooks, React Query, and React Router.
I persisted with this approach for several months and noticed that the breakthrough every developer craves had finally arrived for me. Concepts and topics were becoming easier to grasp.

My skills leveled up and grew larger in the creation of my first major full-stack application: Smart Brain. Smart Brain is a full-stack web application that detects faces in a given image URL. It's connected to a machine-learning REST API that calculates the location of faces in images. I successfully built Smart Brain with this tech stack:

- **Javascript**
- **React**
- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Heroku (Deployment)**

Once again, I found myself filled with hope and eagerness for what the future held. My passion for software engineering and web development was reignited and stronger than ever before.

## Competing In An Oversaturated Market📉

After overcoming numerous life setbacks, I now faced further obstacles on my path to success. I began applying for web developer and software engineer jobs around January 2023. It wasn't long before I realized the job market had shifted dramatically compared to when I sent out my first applications in August of 2022.

Things were about to get worse.
Major tech companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta were either planning or had already laid off thousands of tech employees. The market was now saturated with experienced engineers searching for work, while job postings became scarce.

After submitting over 500 applications and managing to secure a few interviews, I understood I was in it for the long run. I continued to develop my skills, building several small web applications and occasionally tackling LeetCode questions.
I even managed to land interviews with big companies like GitHub and Cigna, performing well and acing the interview, only to be ghosted afterward. Despite the frustration, I kept my spirits high. Companies and interviews don't define your worth - you do.

After four months of relentless job hunting, 500+ applications sent, more than 20 interviews, and endless hours studying useless material, I decided it was time to switch up my strategy.

## Creating My Own Startup Company💡🚀

I came into the software engineering field with a mindset focused primarily on speed and income: land a job as quickly as possible and boost my skills to secure a high-paying role. However, I overlooked a crucial aspect of this field: the skills you acquire are more valuable than the paycheck you earn.

I realized I harnessed the power to create whatever I wanted; I could design any application that I envisioned. I had the means to create full-stack web applications for myself, my friends, and my family. I felt drawn toward creating an affordable platform for anxiety disorder recovery.

Reflecting on my past struggle with severe mental health disorders, I recalled how I couldn't afford the high prices - $200 to $1000 - for anxiety recovery courses. This ignited an idea: why not build an affordable anxiety recovery website myself? A platform that could provide guidance and support for anyone struggling with anxiety, OCD, or DPDR.

And so, I got to work. Over the span of three months, I dedicated hundreds of hours to research, development, design, and programming for my startup. After investing countless hours and pouring in my heart and soul, my website began to take form, and I saw the birth of my very own startup company: FreeMind Recovery. It was an affordable, safe space for anyone battling anxiety, OCD, or DPDR.

Witnessing the growth of my own company, one built entirely from scratch, is one of the most satisfying experiences I've had. The effort poured into FreeMind was driven by passion, and I am profoundly grateful for the skills I acquired that allowed me to accomplish this.

## Beating All The Odds🙏🏼

Perhaps you have an inner battle about pursuing a career in this field. Maybe you are overwhelmed with fear and several "what if" thoughts. The fact is this, it doesn't matter whether you're 16 or 46, a fast learner or a slow one, a college graduate or a high school dropout. Programming is a valuable skill that nearly anyone can learn, and it all comes down to your mindset and determination to achieve it.

You might draw inspiration from my story: a 22-year-old truck driver who found himself sleeping on the side of the road, raised in a blue-collar household where manual labor was the norm and expected. I was set back by severe anxiety disorders and lost everything in the process, yet managed to change my life around and build my startup.

Or perhaps Danny Thompson's story resonates more with you. Danny, a software engineer, spent over a decade frying chicken at a gas station. Despite working over 80 hours a week, he found himself in financial ruin, living in poverty. But Danny decided to change his life. He pursued a career in tech as a self-taught software engineer. His efforts were rewarded when he secured his first role in the tech industry after over eight months of self-study and sleepless nights.

No matter whose story you relate to, or even if you can't see your circumstances reflected in either, know this: a career transition is achievable. It requires determination, hard work, and patience, but is all within your grasp.

## Final Thoughts💭

To this day I have not been able to secure a job in the tech field, but am eternally grateful for the skill set I acquired on this journey. As I mentioned earlier, the skills you acquire are more valuable than the paycheck you earn. Keep learning, stay curious, and stay humble.
